  - Zustand for client-side state (search, category selection)
  - TanStack React Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and interactions
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
