# PAKETY - Grocery Shopping Application

## Overview

PAKETY is a modern grocery shopping web application built with a full-stack architecture using React, Express, PostgreSQL, and custom authentication system. The application provides a clean, mobile-first interface for browsing grocery categories, viewing products, and managing a shopping cart with real-time updates and secure user authentication.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **State Management**: 
  - Zustand for client-side state (search, category selection)
  - TanStack React Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and interactions
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework

- **Development**: Hot reloading with Vite middleware integration

### Project Structure
- **Monorepo Layout**: Client and server code in same repository
- **Shared Types**: Common schema definitions in `/shared` directory
- **Component Organization**: Feature-based component structure
- **UI Components**: Reusable component library in `/client/src/components/ui`

## Key Components

### Database Schema

- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with proper HTTP status codes

## Data Flow

1. **Category Selection**: User selects category → Updates local state → Triggers product fetch
2. **Product Browsing**: Products fetched based on selected category → Displayed in responsive grid
3. **Cart Management**: Add to cart → Optimistic updates → Server synchronization → Cache invalidation
4. **Real-time Updates**: React Query handles background refetching and cache management
